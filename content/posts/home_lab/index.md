# <h1> Complete series coming soon!

One of the things I am keen on not loosing is my ability complete the technical work that I speak with customers about on a daily basis. For being be able to talk about the products after having worked with them leads to much more detailed conversations.

In this section I will aim to cover some of the deployments that I have built in my home lab and the way in which I have achieved this. Believe it or not I have actually configured a nested VCF deployment, okay only the management cluster, but sill somehow managed to get this to work on a single host with only 6 cores and 64GB RAM. Yes, I did have a lot of issues with CPU scheduling, and VM's were starved of CPU but with a couple of retries I got there!
