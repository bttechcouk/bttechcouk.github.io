# a summary about you
summary: 'I have been working in IT for the last 14 years, with my primary focus moving to VMware technologies around 7 years ago. In that time I have benefited significantly from the content that is produced and made available within the vCommunity, now I would like to try and make my own contribution. 

In my current role, takes me away from the tools while I am to aid customers through sales cycles ensuring their business and technology requirements are captured along the way. I will be writing about experiences within my home lab as I work to ensure I keep on top of emerging technology in an effort to remain sharp from a hands on point of view.

It is also important to note that the views expressed on this site are my own and not that of my employer.'
